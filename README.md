# Water Bank
This is a interative website offering visualization tools for the AQUASTAT global water information. </br>
It was implemented based on the responsive site template designed by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/prologue).

## Data resource
We are using the AQUASTAT data for the implementation, the global water information system by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Data is available at http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm

## Project goals
* To visualize the water resources and uses across all the countries and regions in the world. 
* To visualize the historical changes of the water resources and uses to understand the origins and future of water scarcity in the world.
* To visualize the impact (causal relationship) of water shortage on the agriculture productivity and food security. 

## How to run this pipeline
